# MaximizeTerminal README

Have you ever been frustrated that the integrated terminal is too small? Find yourself manually clicking the maximize button often? Yes? Then this extension is for you! 

## How do I use it?

Just press `ctrl+'` and your terminal will now open in its maximized state.

This keybinding can be reconfigured to some extent.

## Why is it useful?

It's useful if: 

- You have a low resolution display

- You don't use the native terminal for your platform

- You just want the terminal to feel more separated from your text/source files

## Extension Settings

These can be found in settings->extensions->maximizeterminal

* `Use Alternative Keybinding`: use ctrl+; to invoke the extension, and leave ctrl+' with its default behaviour

## Extension Commands

This extension implements the following commands:

* `Open Maximized Terminal`: opens the terminal in its maximized state

* `Open Minimized Terminal`: opens the terminal in its minimized state

And it uses the following built-in commands:

* `View: Close Panel`: closes the panel

## Notes

If this extension breaks in the future, please submit a new issue at the GitHub repository.
