# maximizedterminal README

Adds a key binding (ctrl+;) for toggling between maximized terminal and closed panel :)

The first time you use the key binding when you open VS Code, the extension will take a few seconds to initialize before the terminal opens.

## Extension Commands

This extension implements the following commands:

* `Maximize Terminal`: open the terminal in its maximized state

## Notes

I tried to get this extension to override the default key bind for toggle terminal (ctrl + ') 
but nothing I tried would work :(
