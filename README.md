# maximizeterminal README

Have you ever been frustrated that the integrated terminal is too small? Find yourself manually clicking the maximize button often? Yes? Then this extension is for you! 

Adds a new key binding (ctrl+;) for toggling between maximized terminal and closed panel :)

This extension is helpful if you have a low resolution display (like me), or you're on Windows and don't use the native terminal (like me).

## Extension Commands

This extension implements the following commands:

* `Maximize Terminal`: opens the terminal in its maximized state

And it uses the following built-in commands:

* `View: Close Panel`: closes the panel

## Notes

Key binding is optimized for UK-layout keyboard (No other keyboard layouts tested)

The extension may take a few seconds to initialize when you first use the key binding.

I tried to get this extension to override the default key binding for toggle terminal (ctrl + ') 
but nothing I tried would work :(
