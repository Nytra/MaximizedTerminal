# MaximizeTerminal README

Have you ever been frustrated that the integrated terminal is too small? Find yourself manually clicking the maximize button often? Yes? Then this extension is for you! 

Allows you to open the terminal in its maximized state with ctrl+' (this keybind can be changed in settings)

Useful if you have a low resolution display.

## Extension Commands

This extension implements the following commands:

* `Maximize Terminal`: opens the terminal in its maximized state

And it uses the following built-in commands:

* `View: Close Panel`: closes the panel

## Notes

The extension now overrides the default keybinding for opening the terminal (ctrl+')
