# maximizeterminal README

Have you ever been frustrated that the integrated terminal is too small? Find yourself manually clicking the maximize button often? Yes? Then this extension is for you! 

Allows you to open the terminal in its maximized state (with ctrl+; or ctrl+')

Useful if you have a low resolution display.

## Extension Commands

This extension implements the following commands:

* `Maximize Terminal`: opens the terminal in its maximized state

And it uses the following built-in commands:

* `View: Close Panel`: closes the panel

## Notes

Key binding is optimized for UK-layout keyboard (No other keyboard layouts tested)

The extension may take a few seconds to initialize when you first use the key binding.

The extension now overrides the default keybinding for opening the terminal (ctrl+')
Thanks to Pablo-MC on GitHub for this contribution!

I will still be supporting both keybindings (ctrl+; and ctrl+') for now, but will probably switch to purely using the default keybinding in the future.
